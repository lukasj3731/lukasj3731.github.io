                                <h3>Description</h3>
                                <p class="padded-half continued">the Apple watch activity tracking allows you to challenge friends or family members and see who can be more active during a 7 day time period. Sadly, this feature lacks support for group challenges including multiple users. As a simple solution to this problem, I implemented a google sheet document, which analyzed the activity data just as the apple watch does, but compares it to up to 4 other competitors. This enables functionality such as individual achievements within the competition, as well as counting points exceeding 600 points. As we found out the hard way though, the 600 points limit is very reasonably placed, and the current version subtracts points for exceeding the limit, which results in a very competitive, but still fun and motivating competition.</p>
                                <h3>Why</h3>
                                <p class="padded-half continued">The idea of a group activity challenge came up with a group of colleagues all wearing apple watches. We first realized the idea by simultaneously challenging each other all at once, but found the lack of overview within the whole group slightly frustrating. As a quick workaround, I created a Google sheet to track and compare all points. However, this workaround grew and is now a well designed overview with insight similar to the activity app while adding competition specific achievements to strive for.</p>
