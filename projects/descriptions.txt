activity challenge:
the Apple watch activity tracking allows you to challenge friends or family members and see who can be more active during a 7 day time period. Sadly, this feature lacks support for group challenges including multiple users. As a simple solution to this problem, I implemented a google sheet document, which analyzed the activity data just as the apple watch does, but compares it to 4 other competitors. This enables functionality such as individual achievements within the competition, as well as counting points exceeding 600 points. As we found out the hard way though, the 600 points limit is very reasonably placed, and the current version subtracts points for exceeding the limit, which results in a very competitive, but still fun and motivating competition.
