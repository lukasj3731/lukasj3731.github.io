Incognito subs is a tool that gives you an anonymous way to get Youtube recommendations, based on your subscription and keywords instead of an algorithm. Through your watch history, youtube could easily build a personality profile and use this information to influence your opinions through recommendations. To intervene and make this impossible, incognito subs recommends you videos only based on the information you give it willingly. The advantages of this are, that you are immune to be influenced by targeted videos and don't need an account to continue using youtube and watch your favorite creators. The disadvantages are, of course, that you're lacking youtubes very capable algorithm suggesting new videos and trends. Overall, this is a tool for privacy conscious users who can't get away from youtube.

In todays world, social media has an enourmous impact on our lives, but also our decisions, opinions and even personality. Social media can influence people, but also so much more. I recommend watching "The Social Dilemma" if you're interested. It's relatively easy to stop using some social media, but personally I found myself unable to not use YouTube. It's huge range of content and sheer monopoly of videos make it impossible to get off of. To find a compromise and keep being able to watch videos while simultaneously not being influenced by popular trends and algorythm suggestions, I created incognito subs.
